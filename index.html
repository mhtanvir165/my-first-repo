            <p class="pera1">Here we are at the beginning of a New Year! 2022 is here with all the promise and potential
                that every
                New Year
                provides us. Of course, as with every New Year, there are many things that are beyond our control. But
                it is
                important to focus on what we can control. Among them are our attitudes, our conduct, our words, and our
                goals.
