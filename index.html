            <h1 class="h-blue">Captain America</h1>
            <p id="classic-taxt">Captain America: The First Avenger is a 2011 American superhero film based on the
                Marvel Comics character Captain America. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount
                Pictures,[N 1] it is the fifth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by
                Joe
                Johnston, written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers /
                Captain America alongside Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic
                Cooper,
                Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, and Stanley Tucci. During World War II, Steve Rogers, a frail man, is
                transformed into the super-soldier Captain America and must stop the Red Skull (Weaving) from using
                the
                Tesseract as an energy source for world domination.

                The film began as a concept in 1997 and was scheduled for distribution by Artisan Entertainment.
                However, a lawsuit disrupted the project and was not settled until September 2003. In 2005, Marvel
                Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch, and planned to finance and release the film through
                Paramount Pictures. Directors Jon Favreau and Louis Leterrier were interested in directing the
                project
                before Johnston was approached in 2008. The principal characters were cast between March and June
                2010.
                Production began in June, and filming took place in London, Manchester, Caerwent, Liverpool, and Los
                Angeles. Several different techniques were used by the visual effects company Lola to create the
                physical appearance of the character before he becomes Captain America.

                Captain America: The First Avenger premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on July 19, 2011, and was
                released in the United States on July 22, as part of Phase One of the MCU. The film was commercially
                successful, grossing over $370 million worldwide. Critics particularly praised Evans' performance,
                the
                film's depiction of its 1940s time period, and Johnston's direction. Two sequels have been released:
                Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America: Civil War (2016). </p>

            <h1 class="h-gold">Doctor Strange</h1>
            <p id="classic-taxt">Doctor Strange is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character
                of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it
                is the 14th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Scott Derrickson from
                a screenplay he wrote with Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as
                neurosurgeon Stephen Strange along with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael
                Stuhlbarg, Benjamin Bratt, Scott Adkins, Mads Mikkelsen, and Tilda Swinton. In the film, Strange learns
                the mystic arts after a career-ending car crash.

                Various incarnations of a Doctor Strange film adaptation had been in development since the mid-1980s,
                until Paramount Pictures acquired the film rights in April 2005 on behalf of Marvel Studios. Thomas Dean
                Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer were brought on board in June 2010 to write a screenplay. In June 2014,
                Derrickson was hired to direct, with Spaihts re-writing the script. Cumberbatch was chosen for the
                eponymous role in December 2014, necessitating a schedule change to work around his other commitments.
                This gave Derrickson time to work on the script himself, for which he brought Cargill on to help.
                Principal photography on the film began in November 2015 in Nepal, before moving to England and Hong
                Kong, and wrapping up in New York City in April 2016.

                Doctor Strange had its world premiere in Hong Kong on October 13, 2016, and was released in the United
                States on November 4, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film grossed over $677 million worldwide,
                was met with praise for its cast, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. A
                sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, is scheduled for release on May 6, 2022.</p>
